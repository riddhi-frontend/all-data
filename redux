    • React redux is a libraries of react js 
    • React redux is used to state management
    • React redux pass uni-directional of data
    • Redux is used to allow us to read react components data from a Redux store.
    • Redux dispatch actions to store to update data.
    • Redux help apps to scale by providing a sensible way to manage state through a unidirectional data flow model
    • A state management systems for cross-component  or app-wide  state
    • Redux used a wide for web applications.
    • Redux is an libraries that is used to manage data and provides more libraries to manage its data in very simple way.
    • Redux is a useful solution for organizing application state and provides a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
    • It's a well-known framework for managing state in React projects, but it also works with Angular, Vue. js, and plain old JavaScript.
Advantage of react redux ...
1) Redux is unidirectional data flow 
2) Redux used for state managements to update or store data.
3) Redux does not have Dispatcher concept
4) Redux has an only one store where as flux has store.
5) Redux action objects will be received and handled directly by store
6) Redux provides a complex architectures 
7) It encourage a good 'React architectures'

React Redux life cycle & structured ….
a) state
b) ui(user interface)
c) actions
    • Action is sent or dispatched from the view which are payloads that can be read by reducers.
    • It is a pure object created to store the information of users event.
    • It includes information such as type action , time & location of occurrence
    • Its cordinates with state and its aim to change something in apps. 
d) reducer(core function)
    • Reducer is one type of functions where we access some global variables also.
    • Reducer read the payloads from action and then performed updates the store via the state.
    • It is pure function to return view state from the initial state.

e) store 
    • A store is place where the entire state of your applications lists.
    • It manages the status of the applications and has a dispatch(action) in function.
    • It is a like a brain that is responsible for all moving parts in Redux.
