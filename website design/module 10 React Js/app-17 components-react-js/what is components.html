what is React components ? 
components is a small peace of file in react js i.e saved as .js or .jsx
components is reusable
when we create any components so take a firstname as uppercase

Advantages of components :  
  Instant updates without page reloads.
  Use conditional statements within the JSX
  Reuse the same components.
  Update just one component.
  The code is nice and stable.
  React. js is easy to learn.
  
examples : App.jsx or Hello.jsx , Home.jsx
components are called as two types 
 a) function components :
     App.jsx
     function App()
     {
       return (
       
        <>
        
        <h1>Hello i m Brijesh</h1>
        
        </>
       
       )
     }  
       
     function MyApp()

     {
      return (
       <App /> 
        <>
        
        <h3>i am reused function using function components</h3>
            
            
            </>
      )
     
     }

     export default MyApp


     Note : in react 18.0.2 version and uper versions of react we used functions based components

           React hooks are not more supported in class based components.   

 b) class components

     class App extends Component 
     {
       render
       {
       
       <>
       <h1>I am used class Based components</h1>
       
       </>
       
       
       }

       class MyApp extends App 
       {
        render
       {
       
       <>
       <App />
       <h1>I am re-used class Based components</h1>
       
       </>

       }

     }

     export default MyApp
